#Playfair
##A Tool for Drawing Dynamic Pictures

Playfair is based on Bret Victors very cool talk [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662).
Right now it is a direct copy of the tool Bret presents, but I hope to make some improvements on Bret's tool.

Be warned, this is a work in progress. It is buggy, incomplete, and sometimes laggy.

To use download the files off github, and open the index.html file.

Things you can currently do:

- draw the basic svg shapes.
- snap all of the shapes except for path.
- rotate, scale, and move the shapes.
- use shift up or down to select multiple steps, then hit l to loop over the steps.
- use up or down to go to different steps. Hover and drag the numbers to change the step parameters.

I built this project because I wanted to use the tool in Bret's video, and to gain a better understanding of clojurescript. If you have any suggestions for improving the code send me an email at zindlerb@gmail.com to check out other projects I've done visit [www.zindlerb.com](http://www.zindlerb.com).
