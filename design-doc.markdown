Design Doc



Oh dear design doc. What should I do tonight?

--------------
Fix the draw function I say. Check the centered circle.
Get the for text to work I say.
Implement selected step I say. What is really happening when BV selects a step?
Get centering to work.
Save a file of test cases.
Test out rotate. Get that working for all.
Data panel display.





----------------


Abstract problems deserving of more thought.

The 4 quardrants problem. Often I will need to determine where a vector is drawn from, and based on this knowledge subtract or add x and y. It is a vector that depends on where the angle extends to.

I need to learn vectors.



For many of my reduces I really want to comp the vector. Maybe?


Oh design doc why did I make you only to ignore you?
